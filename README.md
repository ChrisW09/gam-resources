# Nonlinear Modeling in R with GAMs: the magical world of mgcv

Slides presented at the New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup on 2017-11-14.  A video of the talk is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4_t8jXcQgc.

Note this is a "gallery of features" talk. Much of the syntax of the code is simplified, pretty much nothing runs as-is.

Additional resources mentioned in the talk include:

-  Simon Wood's [Generalized Additive Models in R](https://www.crcpress.com/Generalized-Additive-Models-An-Introduction-with-R-Second-Edition/Wood/p/book/9781498728331) 
-  Materials from our [2017 Ecological Society of America workshop on GAMs](https://noamross.github.io/mgcv-esa-workshop/)
    -   The [2018 materials](https://noamross.github.io/mgcv-esa-2018/) are almost exactly the same, but we are tracking issues in this repo for future improvement!
-  Gavin Simpsons's excellent, [GAM-centric blog](https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/)
-  Gavin's amazing [Cross Validated answer on spatiotemporal modelling with GAMs](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/244042/trend-in-irregular-time-series-data/306361#306361)
